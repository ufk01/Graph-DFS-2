# Graph-DFS-2
lets assume that we want to find a path which consists of 
maximum 4 cities between cities a and f. There are three paths that satisfy these conditions: 
which are a-e-f, a-c-e-f, a-e-b-f. While printing these paths, you should arrange cities in each 
path alphabetically, e.g The first path should be printed as a-c-e-f and the second path should be 
printed as a-b-e-f. Also, if you find more than one cycles, you should print based on number of 
cities in ascending order for each cycle. Therefore, final output should be as follows for above 
Figure:
1) a-e-f
2) a-b-e-f
3) a-c-e-f
If you cannot find any path, just print “No path”.
City and road information should be read from the user.
Here is the sample argument:
